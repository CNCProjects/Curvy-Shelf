Curvy-Shelf
===========

This is a curvy shelf for CNC cutting

This was cut out on a Handibot. Before you cut this, check out the Sketchup model.

The plywood thickness it's designed for is drawn in Sketchup. If you have something that is different, you'll
need to rework the Sketchup model. The model is all components so it should be pretty easy to edit.
